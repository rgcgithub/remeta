# remeta

**remeta** is a collection of C++ programs for meta-analysis of single variants and gene-based tests using summary statistics from [**regenie**](https://rgcgithub.github.io/regenie/).
It is primarily designed to perform meta-analysis of gene-based tests using exome variants,
and to perform conditional analysis of gene-based tests using imputed variants.

The main features of **remeta** are:

* It performs burden, ACATV, and SKATO meta-analysis from single variant summary statistics.
* Annotations and gene-sets can be updated without re-analysis of individual-level data.
* It only needs a single LD file per study.
* It provides an efficient utility to compute and store LD matrices.
* It can meta-analyze both quantitative and binary traits.
* It very accurately estimates effect sizes, allele frequencies, and genotype counts of gene burden masks from single variant summary statistics.
* It performs effect-size meta-analysis and p-value meta-analysis of single variants.

See the [**remeta** tutorial](tutorial.md) for a step-by-step example.
